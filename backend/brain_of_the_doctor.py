    return """**Immediate Care Steps:**
‚Ä¢ Clean the affected area gently with lukewarm water and a mild, fragrance-free cleanser such as Cetaphil or CeraVe, avoiding harsh scrubbing motions
‚Ä¢ Pat the area completely dry with a clean, soft towel using gentle dabbing motions rather than rubbing to prevent further irritation
‚Ä¢ Apply a cool, damp compress using clean cloth soaked in cool water for 10-15 minutes every 2-3 hours to reduce inflammation and provide relief
‚Ä¢ Avoid touching, scratching, or picking at the affected area to prevent secondary bacterial infection and scarring
‚Ä¢ Remove any jewelry, tight clothing, or accessories that might be in contact with the affected area to reduce friction and irritation

**Comprehensive Treatment Plan:**
‚Ä¢ Apply over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream (1% concentration) in a thin layer twice daily for up to 7 days, following package instructions carefully
‚Ä¢ Consider using topical antihistamine creams like Benadryl cream for localized itching, but avoid prolonged use to prevent sensitization
‚Ä¢ Use oral antihistamines such as loratadine (Claritin) 10mg once daily or cetirizine (Zyrtec) 10mg once daily for systemic relief of itching and inflammation
‚Ä¢ Apply fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer such as Eucerin or Aveeno 2-3 times daily to maintain skin barrier function
‚Ä¢ For severe inflammation, consider cool oatmeal baths (colloidal oatmeal) for 15-20 minutes to soothe irritated skin
‚Ä¢ If bacterial infection is suspected, topical antibiotic ointment like bacitracin may be applied, but consult healthcare provider first

**Lifestyle and Dietary Recommendations:**
‚Ä¢ Maintain a detailed diary of potential triggers including foods, cosmetics, detergents, and environmental factors to identify patterns
‚Ä¢ Adopt a gentle skincare routine using only fragrance-free, hypoallergenic products specifically designed for sensitive skin
‚Ä¢ Wear loose-fitting, breathable clothing made from natural fibers like cotton to reduce friction and allow proper air circulation
‚Ä¢ Implement stress management techniques such as meditation, yoga, or regular exercise, as stress can exacerbate inflammatory skin conditions
‚Ä¢ Consider an anti-inflammatory diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and avoiding known inflammatory foods if dietary triggers are suspected

**When to Seek Professional Medical Care:**
‚Ä¢ If symptoms persist or worsen after 72 hours of appropriate home treatment, indicating possible need for prescription medications
‚Ä¢ Development of systemic symptoms including fever above 100.4¬∞F (38¬∞C), chills, or general malaise suggesting possible systemic infection
‚Ä¢ Signs of secondary bacterial infection such as increasing redness, warmth, swelling, pus formation, or red streaking extending from the affected area
‚Ä¢ Rapid spreading of the condition to multiple body areas or involvement of mucous membranes, which may indicate a serious allergic reaction
‚Ä¢ Severe pain that interferes with daily activities or sleep, or if over-the-counter pain management is insufficient
‚Ä¢ Any signs of anaphylaxis including difficulty breathing, swelling of face or throat, rapid pulse, or dizziness requiring immediate emergency care

**Long-term Prevention Strategy:**
‚Ä¢ Establish a consistent, gentle skincare routine using the same proven products to maintain skin barrier integrity and prevent future flare-ups
‚Ä¢ Conduct systematic patch testing with new products by applying small amounts to a test area for 48-72 hours before full use
‚Ä¢ Maintain optimal skin hydration through regular use of appropriate moisturizers and adequate water intake (8-10 glasses daily)
‚Ä¢ Schedule regular dermatological check-ups every 6-12 months for ongoing skin health monitoring and professional guidance
‚Ä¢ Keep a comprehensive health and skincare journal documenting products used, environmental exposures, and any skin reactions for pattern identification

**Additional Considerations:**
‚Ä¢ Potential complications may include post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, scarring from scratching, or development of chronic dermatitis requiring long-term management
‚Ä¢ Expected timeline for resolution typically ranges from 1-2 weeks for mild cases to 4-6 weeks for more severe inflammatory conditions with appropriate treatment
‚Ä¢ Consider allergy testing if recurrent episodes occur, as identification of specific allergens can guide long-term prevention strategies
‚Ä¢ Monitor for signs of contact sensitization to topical treatments, which may manifest as worsening symptoms despite appropriate treatment
‚Ä¢ Maintain realistic expectations regarding healing time and potential for temporary discoloration or texture changes during the recovery process"""
